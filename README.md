# A/A/B Testing Analysis
Investigate user behavior for a food vendor company's application The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire application but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating.

# Goal
The purpose of this project is to identify which set of fonts produces better results. In order to come to a conclusion, we need to study the sales funnel and analyze an A/A/B test. We also need to find out how users reach the purchase stage, how many users actually make it to this stage, how many get stuck at previous stages, and which stages in particular. The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts (246 and 247) and one test group (248) gets the new ones.

# Statistical Analysis
- Determine if the difference between the alpha groups, 246 and 247, is statistically significant
- Determine if the difference between the alpha and beta groups, 246 and 248, is statistically significant
- Determine if the difference between the alpha and beta groups, 247 and 248, is statistically significant
